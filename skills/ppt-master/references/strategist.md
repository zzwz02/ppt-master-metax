## 1. Eight Confirmations Process

⛔ **BLOCKING**: Before starting analysis, reference `templates/design_spec_reference.md` and provide professional recommendations for the following eight items, then **present them as a bundled package to the user and wait for explicit confirmation or modifications**.

> **Execution discipline**: This is the last BLOCKING checkpoint in the pipeline (besides template selection). Once the user confirms, the AI must automatically complete the Design Specification & Content Outline and seamlessly proceed to subsequent image generation (if applicable), SVG generation, and post-processing — no additional questions or pauses in between.

### a. Canvas Format Confirmation

Recommend format based on scenario (see Canvas Format Quick Reference above).

### b. Page Count Confirmation

Provide specific page count recommendation based on source document content volume.

### c. Key Information Confirmation

Confirm target audience, usage occasion, and core message; provide initial assessment based on document nature.

### d. Style Objective Confirmation

| Style | Core Focus | Target Audience | One-line Description |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **A) General Versatile** | Visual impact first | Public / clients / trainees | "Catch the eye at a glance" |
| **B) General Consulting** | Data clarity first | Teams / management | "Let data speak" |
| **C) Top Consulting** | Logical persuasion first | Executives / board | "Lead with conclusions" |

**Style selection decision tree**:

```
Content characteristics?
  ├── Heavy imagery / promotional ──→ A) General Versatile
  ├── Data analysis / progress report ──→ B) General Consulting
  └── Strategic decisions / persuading executives ──→ C) Top Consulting

Audience?
  ├── Public / clients / trainees ────→ A) General Versatile
  ├── Teams / management ────────────→ B) General Consulting
  └── Executives / board / investors → C) Top Consulting
```

### e. Color Scheme Recommendation

Proactively provide a color scheme (HEX values) based on content characteristics and industry.

**Industry color quick reference** (full 14-industry list in `scripts/config.py` under `INDUSTRY_COLORS`):

| Industry | Primary Color | Characteristics |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Finance / Business | `#003366` Navy Blue | Stable, trustworthy |
| Technology / Internet | `#1565C0` Bright Blue | Innovative, energetic |
| Healthcare / Health | `#00796B` Teal Green | Professional, reassuring |
| Government / Public Sector | `#C41E3A` Red | Authoritative, dignified |

**Color rules**: 60-30-10 rule (primary 60%, secondary 30%, accent 10%); text contrast ratio >= 4.5:1; no more than 4 colors per page.

### f. Icon Usage Confirmation

| Option | Approach | Suitable Scenarios |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | Emoji | Casual, playful, social media |
| **B** | AI-generated | Custom style needed, richer detail than library icons |
| **C** | Built-in icon library | Professional scenarios (recommended for generic concepts) |
| **D** | Custom icons | Has brand assets |

Built-in library contains 7000+ icons across three libraries:

| Library | Style | Count | Prefix | When to use |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `chunk` | fill · straight-line geometry (sharp corners, rectilinear) | 640 | `chunk/` | ✅ **Default** — most scenarios |
| `tabler-filled` | fill · bezier-curve forms (smooth, rounded contours) | 1000+ | `tabler-filled/` | When design calls for smooth, rounded, organic icon forms |
| `tabler-outline` | stroke/line | 5000+ | `tabler-outline/` | Screen-only decks needing a light, elegant aesthetic |

> **Mandatory rules when choosing C**:
> 1. **Lock icon library first** — default to `chunk`; switch to `tabler-filled` only when the design calls for smooth, rounded, organic icon forms; use `tabler-outline` only for screen-only light aesthetic decks:
>    - **Sharp, rectilinear geometry** (default): use `chunk` — all paths use straight-line commands only (M/L/H/V/Z)
>    - **Smooth, rounded forms**: use `tabler-filled` — all contours built with bezier curves and arcs (C/A)
>    - **Outline/Stroke style** (screen-only, light aesthetic): use `tabler-outline`
>    - **Outline/Stroke style** (screen-only, light aesthetic): use `tabler-outline`
>    - ⚠️ **One presentation = one library.** Mixing icons from different libraries is FORBIDDEN. If a chosen library lacks an exact icon, find the closest alternative **within that same library**.
> 2. Search for icon availability: `ls skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/<chosen-library>/ | grep <keyword>`
> 3. Use the verified filename (without `.svg`) as the icon name
> 4. Always include the library prefix (e.g., `chunk/home` or `tabler-filled/home`)
> 5. List the final icon inventory and chosen library in the Design Spec; Executor may only use icons from this list
>
> **Do NOT preload any index file** — use `ls | grep` to search on demand with zero token cost.

> **When choosing B (AI-generated icons)**:
> 1. Define a **style anchor** — a fixed style description shared verbatim across all icon prompts (e.g., "flat vector icon, monochrome dark blue (#1E3A5F), single-weight line-art, white background")
> 2. List each icon in the Design Spec §VI with Type = "AI-generated" and a concise "Generation Description"
> 3. Specify the target monochrome color (one brand color) and background (white/transparent)
> 4. Also list each icon in §VIII Image Resource List with Type = "Icon" and Status = "Pending"
> 5. All icons will be generated by Image_Generator and stored in `images/`

> **When choosing B+C (mixed)**:
> Use built-in library for generic concepts (checkmark, arrow, gear) and AI-generated for concepts needing richer visual detail (brain with synapses, specific industry symbols). Clearly mark each icon's Type in §VI.

### Icon Design Intent (required for all icon options)

In the Design Spec §VI, Strategist must specify:
- **Design approach**: "Icon-as-Label" (functional semantic tags, subordinate to text)
- **Default icon color**: body text color HEX
- **Emphasis icon color**: primary theme color HEX
- **Size tiers used**: which of Primary (48px) / Secondary (32px) / Tertiary (24px) are used

### g. Typography Plan Confirmation (Font + Size)

#### Font Presets

| Scenario | Preset | Title | Body | Emphasis |
|----------|--------|-------|------|----------|
| Modern business, tech | P1 | Microsoft YaHei / Arial | Microsoft YaHei / Calibri | SimHei |
| Government documents, reports | P2 | SimHei | SimSun / Times | SimSun |
| Culture, arts, humanities | P3 | KaiTi / Georgia | Microsoft YaHei | SimHei |
| Traditional, conservative | P4 | SimSun | Microsoft YaHei / Arial | SimSun |
| English-primary | P5 | Arial / Impact | Calibri / Georgia | Arial Black |

#### Font Size Baseline (all sizes in px)

Selection principle: Font size is based on **content density**, not design style.

| Content Density | Points per Page | Body Baseline | Suitable Scenarios |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Relaxed | 3-5 items | 24px | Keynote-style, training materials |
| Dense | 6+ items | 18px | Data reports, consulting analysis |

| Level | Ratio | 24px Baseline | 18px Baseline |
|-------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Cover title | 2.5-3x | 60-72px | 45-54px |
| Page title | 1.5-2x | 36-48px | 27-36px |
| **Body** | **1x** | **24px** | **18px** |
| Annotation | 0.75x | 18px | 14px |

### h. Image Usage Confirmation

| Option | Approach | Suitable Scenarios |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | No images | Data reports, process documentation |
| **B** | User-provided | Has existing image assets |
| **C** | AI-generated | Custom illustrations, backgrounds needed |
| **D** | Placeholders | Images to be added later |

**When selection includes B**, you must run `python3 scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` before outputting the spec, and integrate scan results into the image resource list.

**When B/C/D is selected**, add an image resource list to the spec:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Filename | e.g., `cover_bg.png` |
| Dimensions | e.g., `1280x720` |
| Ratio | e.g., `1.78` |
| Layout suggestion | e.g., `Wide landscape (suitable for full-screen/illustration)` |
| Purpose | e.g., `Cover background` |
| Type | Background / Photography / Illustration / Diagram / Decorative pattern |
| Status | Pending generation / Existing / Placeholder |
| Generation description | Fill in detailed description for AI generation |

**Image type descriptions**:

| Type | Suitable Scenarios |
|------|-------------------|
| Background | Full-page backgrounds for covers/chapter pages; reserve text area |
| Photography | Real scenes, people, products, architecture |
| Illustration | Flat design, vector style, concept diagrams |
| Diagram | Flowcharts, architecture diagrams, concept relationship maps |
| Decorative pattern | Partial decoration, textures, borders, divider elements |

**Image-layout alignment principles** (detailed calculation rules in `references/image-layout-spec.md`):

| Image Ratio | Recommended Layout |
|-------------|-------------------|
| > 2.0 (ultra-wide) | Top-bottom split, top full-width |
| 1.5-2.0 (wide) | Top-bottom split |
| 1.2-1.5 (standard landscape) | Left-right split |
| 0.8-1.2 (square) | Left-right split |
| < 0.8 (portrait) | Left-right split, image on left |

Core logic: The layout container's aspect ratio must closely match the image's original ratio. Never force a wide image into a square container or a portrait image into a narrow horizontal strip.

#### Template-specific image sizing constraints

After selecting the layout type, the Strategist **MUST** check the template's `design_spec.md` (at `<project_path>/templates/design_spec.md`) for any **Image Sizing Rule** (typically in §V-b or similar section). If such a rule exists:

1. Apply the template constraint as an **upper bound** — it overrides the default dimension formulas in `image-layout-spec.md`
2. Calculate and write the **max image width/height** into the Content Outline for each image-bearing page
3. Example: if a template limits image width to ≤ 1/2 of text area (≈ 360px max for a 1094px content area in left-right split), state `max_image_width: 360px` in the outline entry
4. When multiple images appear on one page, their **combined area** must also respect the constraint

This ensures the Executor has an explicit numeric constraint before SVG generation.

> **Pipeline handoff**: When C) AI generation is selected, after outputting the design spec, prompt the user to invoke Image_Generator. Once images are collected in `images/`, proceed to Executor.

### Chart Reference (Non-blocking — Strategist recommends, no user confirmation needed)

When content outline pages involve **data visualization** (comparisons, trends, proportions, KPIs, flows, strategic frameworks, etc.), consult the chart template library to select appropriate chart types.

Built-in library contains 33 chart templates; see `templates/charts/charts_index.json`.

> **Selection workflow**:
> 1. Identify pages that need data visualization during content planning
> 2. Consult `charts_index.json` — by analysis goal → `quickLookup`; by category → `categories`
> 3. Review `bestFor` / `avoidFor` to confirm the chart type fits the data characteristics
> 4. List all selected charts in Design Spec **section VII (Chart Reference List)** as a centralized reference; in section IX Content Outline, each page only needs to note the chart type name
>
> **Quick lookup by goal**:
> - Ranking/comparison → `bar_chart`, `horizontal_bar_chart`, `grouped_bar_chart`
> - Trends over time → `line_chart`, `area_chart`, `dual_axis_line_chart`
> - Proportions → `donut_chart`, `pie_chart`, `treemap_chart`
> - KPIs/targets → `kpi_cards`, `bullet_chart`, `gauge_chart`
> - Conversion/flow → `funnel_chart`, `sankey_chart`, `waterfall_chart`
> - Strategy → `swot_analysis`, `porter_five_forces`, `matrix_2x2`

### Speaker Notes Requirements (Default — no discussion needed)

- File naming: Recommended to match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`), also compatible with `notes/slide01.md`
- Fill in the Design Spec: total presentation duration, notes style (formal / conversational / interactive), presentation purpose (inform / persuade / inspire / instruct / report)
- Split note files must NOT contain `#` heading lines (`notes/total.md` master document MUST use `#` heading lines)

---

## 4. Layout Pattern Quick Reference

| Layout | Suitable Scenarios | PPT 16:9 Reference Dimensions |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Single column centered | Covers, conclusions, key points | Content width 800-1000px, horizontally centered |
| Two-column | Comparative analysis, left-image right-text | Column ratio 1:1 or 3:2, gap 40-60px |
| Three-column | Parallel points, process steps | Column ratio 1:1:1, gap 30-40px |
| Four-quadrant | Matrix analysis, classification | Quadrant 560x250px, gap 20-30px |
| Top-bottom split | Ultra-wide images + text | Image full-width, text area >= 150px height |

---

## 5. Template Flexibility Principle

> Templates are starting points, not endpoints.

The Strategist should make professional judgments on the template basis generated by `scripts/project_manager.py`, considering user needs, content characteristics, and audience:

1. Ratio systems are adjustable (font size ratios are reference values)
2. Color schemes are customizable (based on brand and content)
3. Layout modes can be combined (6 base layouts with free variation)
4. Content structure is extensible (12-chapter framework can be expanded or reduced)
5. Spacing / border radius details adjusted by Executor based on content density

---

## 6. Workflow & Deliverables

### 6.1 Content Planning Strategy

| Style | Content Outline | Design Spec | Speaker Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| A) General Versatile | Intelligently deconstruct source doc; define core theme per page | Visual theme, color scheme, layout principles | Concise presentation script |
| B) General Consulting | Structured logical sections; data-driven insights | Consulting-style colors, structured content layout | Professional terms, data interpretation, conclusion-first |
| C) Top Consulting | SCQA framework, pyramid principle conclusion-first | Data contextualization, strategic color usage | Highly condensed, logically rigorous, conclusion-driven |

### 6.2 Outline Output Specification (Must include 12 chapters)

| Chapter | Content Requirements |
|---------|---------------------|
| I. Project Information | Project name, canvas format, page count, style, audience, scenario, date |
| II. Canvas Specification | Format, dimensions, viewBox, margins, content area |
| III. Visual Theme | Style description, light/dark theme, tone, color scheme (with HEX table), gradient scheme |
| IV. Typography System | Font plan (P1-P5), font size hierarchy (H1-Code, 7 levels) |
| V. Layout Principles | Page structure (header/content/footer zones), 6 layout modes, spacing spec |
| VI. Icon Usage Spec | Source description, placeholder syntax, recommended icon list |
| VII. Chart Reference List | Chart type, reference template path, used-in pages, purpose |
| VIII. Image Resource List | Filename, dimensions, ratio, purpose, status, generation description |
| IX. Content Outline | Grouped by chapter; each page includes layout, title, content points, chart type (if applicable) |
| X. Speaker Notes Requirements | File naming rules, content structure description |
| XI. Technical Constraints Reminder | SVG generation rules, PPT compatibility rules |
| XII. Design Checklist | Pre-generation / post-generation check items |
| XIII. Next Steps | Clarify subsequent pipeline (Image_Generator or Executor) |

**Generation steps**:
1. Read reference template: `templates/design_spec_reference.md`
2. If a brand template was selected (template files exist in `templates/`), read the template's own `templates/design_spec.md` and check for any page types marked **⚠️ MANDATORY**. All mandatory pages must be included in the Content Outline (Section IX) at their specified position (e.g., "second-to-last page"). If no page types are marked MANDATORY, no additional pages are required.
3. Generate complete spec from scratch based on analysis
4. Save to: `projects/<project_name>.../design_spec.md`

---

## 7. Project Folder

The project folder should be created before entering the Strategist role. If not yet created, execute:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <canvas_format>
```

The Strategist saves the Design Specification & Content Outline to `projects/<project_name>_<format>_<YYYYMMDD>/design_spec.md`.

---

## 8. Complete Design Spec and Prompt Next Steps

Prompt the next step based on the confirmed template option and image usage selection.

### Template Option A (Using existing template)

```
✅ Design spec complete. Template ready.
Next step:
- Images include AI generation → Invoke Image_Generator
- Images do not include AI generation → Invoke Executor
```

### Template Option B (No template)

```
✅ Design spec complete.
Next step:
- Images include AI generation → Invoke Image_Generator
- Images do not include AI generation → Invoke Executor (free design for every page)
```
